### Introduction

The
[STM32L0538-DISCO](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32l0538discovery.html)
discovery kit features an ultra low-power stm32l053c8t6 microcontroller with
64KB of FLASH and 8KB of RAM.
The board also provides an on-board 2.04\" E-paper display (not supported yet).

| SPIs                  | SPI1 on PB5 (MOSI), PB4 (MISO), PB3 (SCLK); SPI2 on PB15 (MOSI), PB14 (MISO), PB13 (SCLK) |

## Flashing the device

### Flashing the board using OpenOCD

The board can be flashed using OpenOCD via the on-board ST-Link adapter.
Then use the following command:

    make BOARD=stm32l0538-disco -C examples/hello-world flash

## Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=stm32l0538-disco PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).

### STDIO

STDIO is connected to pins PA9 (TX) and PA10 (RX) so an USB to UART adapter is
required. Use the `term` target to open a terminal:

    make BOARD=stm32l0538-disco -C examples/hello-world term

If an external ST-Link adapter is used, RX and TX pins can be directly connected
to it. In this case, STDIO is available on /dev/ttyACMx (Linux case).
